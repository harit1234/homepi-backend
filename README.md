# homepi-backend
This was my first attempt in making a home-automation system.
basically it involves all the files about the backend that will be running on a raspberry Pi.
it is a local  server that listens on a port and listens to the requests from a frontend app and executes
a python script for switching gpios along with some other functionalities.
